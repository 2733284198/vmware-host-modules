This repository tracks patches needed to build VMware (Player and
Workstation) host modules against recent kernels. As it focuses on recent
kernels (older ones do not need patching), only vmmon and vmnet modules are
currently handled as the rest has been upstreamed for some time.

Main branch master handles only "infrastructure" files which do not belong
to VMware module sources. Two other branches, "player" and "workstation"
track upstream module sources distributed with Player and Workstation,
respectively. Tags of the form "p${version}" (e.g.  "p12.5.5") and
"w${version}" correspond to clean unpacked sources of modules from
a particular version of Player or Workstation.

From these tags, branches "player-${version}" and "workstation-${version}"
are forked. These branches track changes needed to build these modules
against recent kernel versions. Tag "p${ver}-k${ver}" marks the set of
changes needed to build modules from Player ${ver} against kernel ${ver},
e.g. p12.5.5-k4.11 is for Player 12.5.5 and kernel 4.11; similar naming
scheme "w${ver}-k${kver}" is used for Workstation modules. In general,
later points in the branch should also work with older kernels (e.g.
p12.5.5-k4.11 with kernel 4.10) but it's not completely reliable.
